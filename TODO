TODO for mplayerxp:

- replace suspect codecs.conf with built-in database
- remove all #define with values (they maybe intercepted in other .h files)
- add anti-viral protection for QOS("Query of Service") to not be a virus' servant
- add passport control for drivers as one of anti-viral traps.
- add possibility to DISABLE osd.level=2 from cmd line and from keyboard
***
- replace built-in asm with "mmintrin" extensions of GCC (alse available in MSVC, ICC, ...)
- replace network support with using of libavformat
- implement distributed video playback with using of PVM. (need volunteers)
- run filters in independent threads (useful for encoding)
- use original wine instead of loader. (adapt DMO_filter.so for wine)
- redesign demux_mkv and other in demux_asf like manner. (will allow to avoid 1
  unnecessary memcpy for input video bandwidth)
- remove DEMUXER_TYPE_* and STREAMTYPE_* (make modules in libmpdemux more
  independent ones)
